# Bamboo–Fly Ash Concrete Tiles

This repository presents my research and project work on **sustainable blended concrete using bamboo and fly ash**. The project explored innovative construction materials to improve crack resistance, durability, and sustainability in pavement applications.

## Overview
As part of my undergraduate research, I investigated a concrete mix with partial replacement using bamboo and fly ash. The study focused on creating eco-friendly alternatives to conventional mixes while maintaining cost efficiency and performance.  

Key outcomes included enhanced crack resistance and improved sustainability, making this solution promising for pavement and infrastructure use.
