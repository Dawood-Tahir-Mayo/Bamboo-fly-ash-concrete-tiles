# Bamboo-Fly-Ash-Concrete-Tiles

This repository contains my undergraduate research on sustainable concrete using bamboo fibers and fly ash. The purpose of the study was to develop an eco-friendly concrete mix that could reduce cement use while improving crack resistance.

The work included mix design, testing, and documentation. Results showed about 28% higher crack resistance compared to normal concrete, which makes the mix suitable for small-scale pavement applications.

Contents:
- reports (thesis draft, research article, documentation)
- data (test results, mix proportions in Excel/CSV)
- drawings (AutoCAD sketches, diagrams)
- photos (lab work, sample preparation, testing)

Tools used: AutoCAD, MS Excel, ASTM C78 testing.

This work has been submitted as a first-author article to the Fusion Journal of Engineering and Science (under review).
